1902–04 recession,9/1/1902,8/1/1904,1 year 11 months,1 year 9 months, 0.162 , 0.171 ,"Though not severe, this downturn lasted for nearly two years and saw a distinct decline in the national product. Industrial and commercial production both declined, albeit fairly modestly. The recession came about a year after a 1901 stock crash."
Panic of 1907,5/1/1907,6/1/1908,1 year 1 month,2 years 9 months, 0.292 , 0.310 ,"A run on Knickerbocker Trust Company deposits on October 22, 1907, set events in motion that would lead to a severe monetary contraction. The fallout from the panic led to Congress creating the Federal Reserve System."
Panic of 1910–1911,1/1/1910,1/1/1912,2 years,1 year 7 months, 0.147 , 0.106 ,"This was a mild but lengthy recession. The national product grew by less than 1%, and commercial activity and industrial activity declined. The period was also marked by deflation."
Recession of 1913–1914,1/1/1913,12/1/1914,1 year 11 months,1 year, 0.259 , 0.198 ,"Productions and real income declined during this period and were not offset until the start of World War I increased demand.

This was a brief but very sharp recession and was caused by the end of wartime production, along with an influx of labor from returning troops. This, in turn, caused high unemployment."
Depression of 1920–21,1/1/1920,7/1/1921,1 year 6 months,10 months, 0.381 , 0.327 ,"The 1921 recession began a mere 10 months after the post-World War I recession, as the economy continued working through the shift to a peacetime economy. The recession was short, but extremely painful. The year 1920 was the single most deflationary year in American history; production, however, did not fall as much as might be expected from the deflation. GNP may have declined between 2.5 and 7 percent, even as wholesale prices declined by 36.8%. The economy had a strong recovery following the recession."
1923–24 recession,5/1/1923,6/1/1924,1 year 2 months,2 years, 0.254 , 0.227 ,"From the depression of 1920–21 until the Great Depression, an era dubbed the Roaring Twenties, the economy was generally expanding. Industrial production declined in 1923–24, but on the whole this was a mild recession."

Charles P. Kindleberger says the period from 1925 to the start of the Great Depression is best thought of as a boom, and this minor recession just proof that the boom ""was not general, uninterrupted or extensive""."
