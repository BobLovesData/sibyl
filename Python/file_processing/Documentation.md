# Welcome to the documentation for this file processing module

There are three main parts of the module

* The File Retriever
* The File Converter
* The File Processor


## FileRetriever()


This object is responsible for downloading data files from a remote source and saving it on your local machine.

  This Object takes all files from the landing folder, converts them to a .csv if necessary, and moves them into the processing folder for later use.

> Currently supported file extensions:
> * .csv  

### Functions

    convert_files(source, target)
        This function interates over all files in folder and creates an object appropriate to the file extention that will convert the file if necessary and move it to a processing folder.

## File Processor()

This object takes files from a processing folder, moves them to a staging table using pandas and mssql, adds or updates a timestamp, and moves the file to an archive folder.

### Functions

        Moves the files from the processing folder, adds a timestamp, and places it into the archive folder

        file - file to be moved.

        source - Where the file is located. Uses relative path.

        target - Where the file will be moved to. Uses relative path.

</br>

    add_timestamp(file, stamp(optional))
        Adds a timestamp to a filename.

        file - File to add timestamp to.

    stage_data(file, source, schema(optional))
        Stages data into SQL Server DB

        file - File to be staged to DB

        source - Where the file is located

        schema - Help organize data in DB
            Default - 'qdl'

## How to use

All objects can be accessed from the ETL file. To import an Object use the following:  
>`from ETL import 'ETL Process you wish to use'`

## Config file

This project uses a .yaml file to hold config settings for the database connection and the email notifications.

### Database
